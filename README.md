## Problem Statement :
* Our client current system depends on excel sheets to organize their database which is not secure, so many clientâ€™s data has been deleted. This sets case managers back and loses track of their communications with clients as well as next of kin information, probation contact etc.
And also with the current system, it is very hard to draw data form easily and generating reports.

## Our Solution :
* Create a new system for case managers of bounceBack which contains a secure database to manage all operations, and create a data visualisation frontend to allow them to understand and navigate their extensive data set better.
